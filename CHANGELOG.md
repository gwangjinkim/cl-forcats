## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Removed emojis from README.md (maintainer preference: no emojis in
  documentation). Meaning is kept in words where an emoji carried it
  (topic: docs style).
- Stopped tracking `build/` (22 files, 796K): the ASDF/Roswell compile
  cache that `make test` writes via `XDG_CACHE_HOME=$(PWD)/build`. It held
  compiled fasls, including Quicklisp internals and absolute local paths.
  `build/` is now in `.gitignore`; local files are untouched. Old copies
  remain in history (topic: repo hygiene).
